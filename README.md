# flask-blog-website

I've build a very simple blog with a number of blog posts. Where you can see the title and subsitle. And also you can click on More to see the blog post in detail, you go to a different page.

And depending on which of these blog posts you've clicked on, you can see that I'm rendering basically the same layout, the same styling and the same structure, each time for each of these pages, you're getting some different content. Also I add a clickable title to come back to home page.
